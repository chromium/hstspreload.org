      This form is used to submit domains for inclusion in Chrome's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a> preload list.
      This is a list of sites that are hardcoded into Chrome as being HTTPS only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most major browsers (Chrome, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/">Firefox</a>, Opera, Safari, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/06/09/http-strict-transport-security-comes-to-internet-explorer-11-on-windows-8-1-and-windows-7/">IE 11 and Edge</a>) also have HSTS preload lists based on the Chrome list. (See the <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=stricttransportsecurity">HSTS compatibility matrix</a>.)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="submission-requirements">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</a></h2>
    <p>If a site sends the <tt>preload</tt> directive in an HSTS header, it is considered to be requesting inclusion in the preload list and may be submitted via the form on this site.</p>
    <p>In order to be accepted to the HSTS preload list through this form, your site must satisfy the following set of requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Serve a valid <b>certificate</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Redirect</b> from HTTP to HTTPS on the same host, if you are listening on port 80.</li>
      <li>Serve all <b>subdomains</b> over HTTPS.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In particular, you must support HTTPS for the <tt>www</tt> subdomain if a DNS record for that subdomain exists.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Serve an <b>HSTS header</b> on the base domain for HTTPS requests:
        <ul>
          <li>The <tt>max-age</tt> must be at least eighteen weeks (<tt>10886400</tt> seconds).</li>
          <li>The <tt>includeSubDomains</tt> directive must be specified.</li>
          <li>The <tt>preload</tt> directive must be specified.</li>
          <li>If you are serving an additional redirect from your HTTPS site, that redirect must still have the HSTS header (rather than the page it redirects to).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For more details on HSTS, please see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">RFC 6797</a>.

      Here is an example of a valid HSTS header:
    </p>
    <p class="header-example main-header-example"">
      <span><tt>Strict-Transport-Security:</tt></span> <span><tt>max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</tt></span>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can check the status of your request by entering the domain name again in the form above, or consult the current Chrome preload list by visiting <tt>chrome://net-internals/#hsts</tt> in your browser.
      Note that new entries are hardcoded into the Chrome source code and can take several months before they reach the stable version.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="continued-requirements">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#continued-requirements">Continued Requirements</a></h2>
    <p>
      You must make sure your site continues to satisfy the submission requirements at all times. Note that removing the <tt>preload</tt> directive from your header will make your site immediately eligible for the <a href="https://hstspreload.org/removal/">removal form</a>, and that sites may be removed automatically in the future for failing to keep up the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, the <a href="#submission-requirements">requirements above</a> apply to all domains submitted through <tt>hstspreload.org</tt> (or <tt>hstspreload.appspot.com</tt>) on or after <b>February 29, 2016</b> (i.e. preloaded after Chrome 50).

  <section id="deployment-recommendations">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#deployment-recommendations">Deployment Recommendations</a></h2>

    <p>
      If your site is committed to HTTPS and you want to preload HSTS, we suggest the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Examine all subdomains (and nested subdomains) of your site and make sure that they work properly over HTTPS.</li>
      <li>Add the <tt>Strict-Transport-Security</tt> header to all HTTPS responses and ramp up the <tt>max-age</tt> in stages, using the following header values:
        <ul>
          <li>
            5 minutes:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=300; includeSubDomains</tt>
          </li>
          <li>
            1 week:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=604800; includeSubDomains</tt>
          </li>
          <li>
            1 month:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains</tt>
          </li>
        </ul>
        During each stage, check for broken pages and monitor your site's metrics (e.g. traffic, revenue). Fix any problems that come up and then wait the full <tt>max-age</tt> of the stage before you move on. For example, wait a month in the last stage.
      <li>Once you're confident that there will be no more issues, increase the <tt>max-age</tt> to 2 years and submit your site to the preload list:
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 years, requesting to be preloaded:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</tt>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you have a group of employees or users who can beta test the deployment, consider trying the first few ramp-up stages on those users. Then make sure to go through all stages for all users, starting over from the beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consult the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/Web_Security">Mozilla Web Security guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/?hl=en">Google Web Fundamentals pages on security</a> for more concrete advice about HTTPS deployment.

    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#opt-in">Preloading Should Be Opt-In</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you maintain a project that provides HTTPS configuration advice or provides an option to enable HSTS, <b>do not include the <tt>preload</tt> directive by default</b>. We get regular emails from site operators who tried out HSTS this way, only to find themselves on the preload list by the time they find they need to remove HSTS to access certain subdomains. <a href="#removal">Removal</a> tends to be slow and painful for those sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's great to support HSTS preloading as a best practice, and for projects to provide a simple option to enable it. However, site operators who enable HSTS should know about the long-term consequences of preloading before they turn it on for a given domain. They should also be informed that they need to meet additional requirements and submit their site to <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">hstspreload.org</a> to ensure that it is successfully preloaded (i.e. to get the full protection of the intended configuration).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="removal">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#removal">Removal</a></h2>
    <p>
      Be aware that inclusion in the preload list cannot easily be undone.
      Domains can be removed, but it takes months for a change to reach users with a Chrome update and we cannot make guarantees about other browsers.
      Don't request inclusion unless you're sure that you can support HTTPS for <b>your entire site and all its subdomains</b> the long term.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we will generally honor requests to be removed from Chrome's preload list if you find that you have a subdomain that you cannot serve over HTTPS for strong technical or cost reasons.
      To request removal, please visit the <a href="/removal/">removal form</a>.
